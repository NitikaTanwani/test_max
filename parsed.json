Undertaking a quality booklength dissertation demands an accumulation of knowledge virtually impossible for those relatively new to their disciplines. The student consequently either seeks to compensate for poor quality with quantity or ends up spending years producing a work of quality. Either way, the dissertation is counterproductive and frustrates the appropriate goals of the doctoral program.<br /><br />The claim that doctoral dissertations should not be required in the humanities plays which one of the following roles in the argument?<br /><br /><br /><br />", "null": ["It is an example illustrative of a general principle concerning the goals of Ph.D. programs.", "It is what the argument is attempting to establish.", "It provides evidence for the assumption that requirements for degrees in the humanities differ from requirements for degrees in other disciplines.", "It confirms the observation that the requirement for a dissertation can frustrate the goals of a doctoral program.", "C"], "question_id": "988"}, {"Category": "Main Point Questions", "answer": "It provides evidence in support of a general claim.", "question": "Henry:&nbsp;&nbsp;Some scientists explain the dance of honeybees as the means by which honeybees communicate the location of whatever food source they have just visited to other members of the hive.

There must therefore be some other explanation for the honeybees' dance.<br /><br />Winifred:&nbsp;&nbsp;Not necessarily.  Most animals have several ways of accomplishing critical tasks.
